## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `_vectors.h` header file for (eventual) de-duplication of vectors across tests
- Base58 encode/decode support
- RipeMD-160 hash support

## [1.1.4] - 2022-06-06
De-duplication of transformation and compression routines for the sake of sanity. It's also kinda useful for custom integration of hashing routines, without even more duplication.

## [1.1.3] - 2022-05-18
Update to `build-c-1.2.1` for GIT_VERSION def and improved makefile.
Also updated Documentation.

### Removed
- Erroneous __device__ specifiers on variables within "device" functions
- Erroneous __align__ specifiers on variables within "device" functions
- Unused DEV_* device mode definitions

## [1.1.2] - 2022-04-15
Addresses the naive padding within hashing structs.
Moved global static vars inside associated function scopes.
Updated to `build-c-1.1.3`.

## Added
- build-c-1.1.3 CUDA compilation (revert) changes

## Changed
- Moved static "global" variables inside associated function scopes
  - due to issues with compilation units that include multiple source files

## Removed
- Alignment padding within hashing contexts
  - Such padding cannot be guarenteed by the C standard

## [1.1.1] - 2022-04-13
Update to build-c-1.1.2 for CUDA build fixes and docs config adjustments.

## [1.1.0] - 2022-04-06
CUDA source code separation.

### Added
- Separate CUDA source code files for all Cryptographic Hashing functions
- Test files for all CUDA variant Cryptographic Hashing functions

### Changed
- Upated build-c to v1.1.1

## [1.0.0] - 2022-01-26
Initial repository release.

### Added
- Cryptographic hasing functions:
  - blake2b
  - crc16
  - crc32
  - md2
  - md5
  - sha1
  - sha256
  - sha3/keccak
